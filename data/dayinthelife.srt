1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This one is a longer note. I want to describe my whole day. I want to see how much time it takes to transcribe the whole thing.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I have to speak a little Hindi in between. I don't know how much issue there is about it.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Also, yeah, I started my day. I woke up. I made some breakfast for myself, put my eye drops because I had done my lasik surgery.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So I had to keep putting my eye drops. I keep calling them ear drops. They are not ear drops, they are eye drops.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I have four in the morning. Then I have one every two hours. Yeah, that's pretty much the whole plan.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Other than that, of course, I ate. Just wasted time.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I went to the gym around 11.30 and then worked. I had a leg day. It was brutal.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:07,000
After the leg day, I just came back, took the one and a half hour train back so I had to only pay two per night.

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Then came back, made lunch, had my protein shake and only laced around.

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I did not do any work till 7 or 8 in the night when I was like, man, now I need to do something because the day is just about to get over.

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:31,000
But yeah, it's not been a very productive day, but that's fine because I'm not being asked to be productive for an hour.

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So that's fine. Soon the day will be very different, but one good thing I look forward to is meeting people, working with them, discussing things.

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Just by myself, I'm a complete loafer. We already know that there's nothing new about it.

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
But that's been pretty much my day. Pretty chill. I think much.

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But yeah, this is a longer note, two minute note about just speaking about my day pretty much.
