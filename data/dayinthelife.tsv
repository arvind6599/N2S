0	8000	This one is a longer note. I want to describe my whole day. I want to see how much time it takes to transcribe the whole thing.
8000	13000	I have to speak a little Hindi in between. I don't know how much issue there is about it.
13000	24000	Also, yeah, I started my day. I woke up. I made some breakfast for myself, put my eye drops because I had done my lasik surgery.
24000	33000	So I had to keep putting my eye drops. I keep calling them ear drops. They are not ear drops, they are eye drops.
33000	42000	I have four in the morning. Then I have one every two hours. Yeah, that's pretty much the whole plan.
42000	48000	Other than that, of course, I ate. Just wasted time.
48000	57000	I went to the gym around 11.30 and then worked. I had a leg day. It was brutal.
57000	67000	After the leg day, I just came back, took the one and a half hour train back so I had to only pay two per night.
67000	73000	Then came back, made lunch, had my protein shake and only laced around.
73000	82000	I did not do any work till 7 or 8 in the night when I was like, man, now I need to do something because the day is just about to get over.
82000	91000	But yeah, it's not been a very productive day, but that's fine because I'm not being asked to be productive for an hour.
91000	101000	So that's fine. Soon the day will be very different, but one good thing I look forward to is meeting people, working with them, discussing things.
101000	109000	Just by myself, I'm a complete loafer. We already know that there's nothing new about it.
109000	114000	But that's been pretty much my day. Pretty chill. I think much.
114000	120000	But yeah, this is a longer note, two minute note about just speaking about my day pretty much.
